# PetalLocal - Local Flower Marketplace

## Overview

PetalLocal is a full-stack TypeScript marketplace that connects local flower growers and florists directly with buyers seeking fresh, beautiful flowers. The platform enables flower growers to list their blooms and manage inventory while providing buyers with search, browse, and purchase capabilities for fresh local flowers.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **React-based SPA**: Built with React 18 and TypeScript for type safety
- **Client-side routing**: Uses Wouter for lightweight routing
- **State management**: React Query for server state and React hooks for local state
- **UI components**: Radix UI components with Tailwind CSS styling using shadcn/ui design system
- **Build system**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Express.js server**: TypeScript-based REST API server
- **Session-based authentication**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL session store
- **Middleware stack**: CORS handling, request logging, error handling
- **File serving**: Static file serving for production builds

### Database Layer
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for all application data (Local or Neon serverless)
- **Neon Integration**: Serverless PostgreSQL with automatic scaling and connection pooling
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database operations with schema-first approach
- **Connection pooling**: Neon serverless database client with WebSocket support
- **Migration System**: Automated data migration from local PostgreSQL to Neon
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-based session store compatible with both databases

## Key Components

### Database Schema
The application uses a comprehensive schema with the following main entities:
- **Users**: Support for farmer, buyer, and admin roles with profile information
- **Farms**: Farm details including location, organic certification, and contact info
- **Produce Items**: Product listings with categories, pricing, and attributes
- **Inventories**: Stock management for produce items
- **Orders & Order Items**: Order processing and line item tracking

### Authentication System
- Session-based authentication using express-session
- Role-based access control (farmer, buyer, admin)
- PostgreSQL session storage for persistence
- Middleware for protecting routes and role validation

### API Structure
RESTful API endpoints organized by domain:
- `/api/auth/*` - Authentication and user management
- `/api/produce/*` - Produce item CRUD operations
- `/api/farms/*` - Farm management
- `/api/orders/*` - Order processing
- `/api/admin/*` - Admin dashboard functionality

### Frontend Pages & Components
- **Public pages**: Home, browse produce, farm details, authentication
- **Protected pages**: Cart, farmer dashboard, admin dashboard
- **Reusable components**: ProduceCard, FarmCard, UI components from shadcn/ui
- **Custom hooks**: useAuth, useCart for state management

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Session-based auth with PostgreSQL session store
2. **Product Discovery**: Browse/search produce with filtering by category and location
3. **Shopping Cart**: Client-side cart management with persistent storage
4. **Order Processing**: Order creation with payment integration (Stripe mock)
5. **Notifications**: Email confirmations via SendGrid (mock implementation)
6. **Error Tracking**: Sentry integration for production error monitoring (optional)

## External Dependencies
